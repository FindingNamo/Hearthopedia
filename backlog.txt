Must:
[ ] Weird margin around the searchbox

Roy
[ ] - Be clever and decorate Enums to get "friendly" names to put into text boxes.  (HeroPower shows up atm).

Something like:
public enum Mechanic
{
	[FriendlyName("Affected by spell damage");
    [Description("Damage increased by spell damage.")]
	AffectedBySpellDamage = 71,
}

If all enums have Friendly names we can put that string into the UI everywhere except the actual enum name.
(Basically allows us to have spaces, and loc if you want.

[ ] - EnumUtils - TryCatches for unknowns enums? Maybe return Unknown for now?
[ ] - Allow Search with no text (Scenario: I want to see all legendary cards)

Like
[ ] Data page is missing if the item is collectable
    - Information is already there, just not displayed.

[ ] Missing Disenchant info
    - Need a new request to get this information.

[ ] Arena Mode to make sure people keep using the app

[ ] Clean up GetDataFromHeathHead.  It's nasty in there.
