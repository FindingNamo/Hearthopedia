Must:
[ ] Filters
[ ] Weird margin around the searchbox
[x] First tap even if drag registers as click
    - This only repros if launching from VS, if you click the app its fine.  I think its a focus issue with the emulator, Won't Fix.



Like
[ ] Data page is missing if the item is collectable
    - Information is already there, just not displayed.

[ ] Missing Disenchant info
    - Need a new request to get this information.

[ ] Make an enum for card types, card sets and card quality because we use them in different places and they are hardcoded there in a duplicated way

[ ] Arena Mode to make sure people keep using the app

[ ] Clean up GetDataFromHeathHead.  It's nasty in there.
