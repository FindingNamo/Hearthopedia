Must:
[ ] - Filters for Windows

[ ] - Image Caching

[ ] - EnumUtils - TryCatches for unknowns enums? Maybe return Unknown for now?

Like
[ ] Data page is missing if the item is collectable
    - Information is already there, just not displayed.

[ ] Missing Disenchant info
    - Need a new request to get this information.

[ ] Arena Mode to make sure people keep using the app

[ ] Clean up GetDataFromHeathHead.  It's nasty in there.
