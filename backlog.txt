Must:
[ ] Weird margin around the searchbox
[x] First tap even if drag registers as click
    - This only repros if launching from VS, if you click the app its fine.  I think its a focus issue with the emulator, Won't Fix.

[ ] - Filter Framework pisses Roy off, shouldn't need so many classes, would be nice to have just one for enums.
[ ] - Filter Framework needs "mechanics" - CardMechanicFilter -> checks all filters for that one mechanic, slow but ez
[ ] - Filters need a ToString method - for the list view.
[ ] - Remove individual filters from FilterManager via the list view.
[ ] - EnumUtils - CamelCase to string?
[ ] - EnumUtils - TryCatches for unknowns enums? Maybe return Unknown for now?
[ ] - NumberFilterPicker - Safeguard input.
[ ] - Trigger new search on Filters changed.
[ ] - Allow Search with no text (Scenario: I want to see all legendary cards)

Like
[ ] Data page is missing if the item is collectable
    - Information is already there, just not displayed.

[ ] Missing Disenchant info
    - Need a new request to get this information.

[ ] Make an enum for card types, card sets and card quality because we use them in different places and they are hardcoded there in a duplicated way

[ ] Arena Mode to make sure people keep using the app

[ ] Clean up GetDataFromHeathHead.  It's nasty in there.
